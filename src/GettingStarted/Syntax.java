* Every Java program has a class name which must match the filename,
  and that every program must contain the main() method.
* Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

* System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out,
  which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line",
  is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

* You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
